The name is used in France in the dish known as "gnocchis à la parisienne", a hot dish comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with Béchamel sauce. A specialty of Nice, the "gnocchi de tantifla a la nissarda", is made with potatoes, wheat flour, eggs and "blette" (Swiss chard), which is also used for the "tourte de blette". "La merda dé can" is longer than the original gnocchi.
