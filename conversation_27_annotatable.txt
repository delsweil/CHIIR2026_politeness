Do you have any questions about the tools or ingredients required to make pesto?
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcd14mqW3ykZR_3PDE] [conversation.participant=agent]

no i have a pestle and mortar

where is the note about pecorino fiore sardo
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcdGXcsiVOm0IIG_P3] [conversation.participant=user]

The note is actually not there so don't worry about it!
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcdSSsqRB6Di9p4CKD] [conversation.participant=agent]

ok
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcdUxw7hw-W8tILk31] [conversation.participant=user]

could i use chilli olive oil
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcdbW3DizvJGYEeDlT] [conversation.participant=user]

That is a great question! I would not recommend using chilli olive oil.  More precisely, as long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKcdqysw-DoDAY_NTSM] [conversation.participant=agent]

ok i have regular olive oil so will use that. i might put some walnuts in as well as the pine nuts
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKce02Gt07Jw25Q8Jqz] [conversation.participant=user]

Yes, that would work.  Most recipes for pesto sauce call for pine nuts, but walnuts are not unheard of.
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKceBY9qX2ViqClz_Wn] [conversation.participant=agent]

Also,  toasting nuts is not worth it.
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKceGo1qa2sy6-atGU2] [conversation.participant=agent]

ive made pesto many times so have a good idea of what to do.  um surprised preparation time is 30 minutes because it is usully very quick to make
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKceIop3NTibtDJscPw] [conversation.participant=user]

I think that just depends on whether you are using a food processor or mortar and pestle.

Also, as a reminder, whenever you want to go to the next step simply type "next". If you want to go to a previous step type "previous". But if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
[conversation_id=2b71cb60] [conversation.id=-NKceZRpghu-COaf2Ag2] [conversation.participant=agent]

i usually use a blender instead of a pestle and mortar

Yes it does. To boost the 'shelf-life' of the pesto in the fridge, make sure that it is completely covered with olive oil before sealing the container.
