It's perfect for this recipe as you want a good melter with low water content.  That means a semifirm cheese that can be grated into shreds, like Gruyère or cheddar.

[conversation_id=7460a2a0] [conversation.id=-NKgsSHpYEKbPNNLNa86] [conversation.participant=user]

A soufflé is a baked egg-based dish which originated in early eighteenth century France. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb "souffler" which means "to blow", "to breathe", "to inflate" or "to puff". The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.

[conversation_id=7460a2a0] [conversation.id=-NKguKmwMFGRjmU0X9t3] [conversation.participant=user]

Potassium bitartrate, also known as cream of tartar, is commonly used as an acidulant in confectionery and candy making. The use of cream of tartar imparts a honey-like flavor to the syrup.

What is the best method to separate egg yolk from the white?
[conversation_id=7460a2a0] [conversation.id=-NKgvI764M10d-2sdVk6] [conversation.participant=user]

I have to say, there's no single best way to separate an egg. First, though, a few tips: Make sure your hands are scrupulously clean. No matter how you separate your eggs, the yolks and whites are likely to come into contact with your fingers. You don't want to transfer anything germy from your hands to the eggs. No matter what method you use, start by gently cracking the egg against a flat surface, so that you don't get eggshell into the egg. Cold eggs are easier to separate than those at room temperature; the yolk breaks less easily.  Fresh eggs are easier to separate than older ones. After cracking the egg, gently pry the shell halves apart. Let the yolk settle into the bottom half of the shell, allowing the white to run over the shell and into a measuring cup or small bowl. Some white will remain with the yolk, so you can gently transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell, continuing to let the white drip over the shell into the bowl.

[conversation_id=7460a2a0] [conversation.id=-NKgzr1Pwb9l6Va7XemH] [conversation.participant=user]

That is a great question!  That gentle folding is key since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them.
