does it matter what type of paprika is used
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DakYzXhICEp2g0aHB] [conversation.participant=user]

No it does not matter. Simply use paprika to add heat and peppery flavour

why does the chicken have to rest in the zip lock back before its mixed in the flour mixture
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DbhHxtdUJb-BkL08Z] [conversation.participant=user]

That's a really great question! You should place the chicken in a zip lock bag in order to brine it. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.

does it matter if it sits for longer then the 24 hours?
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DcG5ta97kP0d2fLFC] [conversation.participant=user]

Usually, you should be brining your chicken breast anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours. However, a much, much longer brining time mitigates the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat.

how do i maintain the correct temperature of the oil
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DdRpFEKlkxw9P431E] [conversation.participant=user]

We know that shimmering oil is hotter than pooled oil (it starts shimmering at around 300 to 400°F), while smoking oil is hotter still (depending on the type of oil, this begins at around 450 to 500°F). In other words, oil is a built-in temperature indicator so simply looking at it should be enough

is the chicken transferred to the wire mesh immediately after coating with the flour?
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DeooqdxaE9O9I-2MO] [conversation.participant=user]

Yes, one piece at a time, transfer the coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour.
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4Df5ci2vuEgWsQmeDI] [conversation.participant=agent]

what do I do if the chicken is sticking to the pan once in the oil
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DfDIUtoZfB0IfcqV0] [conversation.participant=user]

To avoid that you should adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Then fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating.  Then, carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.

should I use a lid?
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DfdTPxMc1JJoQVW2E] [conversation.participant=user]

You can use a lid over the pan to cook through. Any lid will do (sauce pan, baking dish etc.) as long as it mostly covers the food being cooked, without touching it, and is heatproof.
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DfwB9GkaLtPt1xHJE] [conversation.participant=agent]

does it matter what type of pan is used to fry the chicken in ?
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4Dg3VGfp-btehI4b76] [conversation.participant=user]

It's highly recommended to use a wok or chicken fryer
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4Dg9PnC5Mi6v2vok8e] [conversation.participant=agent]

[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4Dh1DpwV3pklRNvcVp] [conversation.participant=user]

No, you should bake until thickest part of breast pieces registers 150°F (65.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer, and thigh/drumstick pieces register 165°F (74°C), 5 to 10 minutes

Then remove chicken pieces as they reach their target temperature.

Is the total fry time about 5 minutes
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DhbDAgCOiw6PQwcjF] [conversation.participant=user]

No. Once you have gone through the previous steps you can simply serve the chicken. However, if you placed the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight then you would have to reheat the oil to 400°F., add the chicken pieces and cook until completely crisp for about 5 minutes.

is it safe to use the oil your used in the beginning as you do in the last step
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DiGEzC5dm6VH9SEbE] [conversation.participant=user]

You don't have to throw out used oil. Often you can reuse it many, many times! but there's no hard and fast rule for how many time you can reuse that oil. Distrust any source that gives a firm answer on the number times you can reuse oil. It's easy to tell when you'll need to replace your oil.
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DieYHLwzIGMtuC2Nl] [conversation.participant=agent]

is the oil safe since you cooked raw chicken in it to begin with
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DioUzuzhQZ8gh4baE] [conversation.participant=user]

I'm not sure I have an answer to your question. However, as a general rule  the more oil breaks down, the less hydrophobic it becomes. At first, this can actually be an advantage. Less hydrophobic molecules in your oil means that it can come into closer contact with foods, allowing them to fry just a bit more efficiently. However,   as this breakdown continues, your oil becomes less and less hydrophobic, and eventually it'll start entering your food too rapidly, causing it to turn greasy and ruining its crispness. At this point you would have to change it

should a wire rack be used to drain and will using paper towels to drain cause  the chicken to not be crispy
[conversation_id=55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71] [conversation.id=-N4DjYMkFCtBRowqXl-F] [conversation.participant=user]

You should transfer the chicken to a wire rack to let it drain. Alternatively, you can use a paper towel-lined plate.
