That's a really good question. So does It Matter What Kind of Mortar and Pestle You Use for Pesto? So if you use a ceramic mortar with a narrow ceramic pestle, the results are good, but the sauce never fully emulsifies.  The Thai granite mortar and pestle does a much better job, but it still didn't come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle.  That large pestle head is perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yields under it in a fraction of the time and breaks down more fully.

[conversation_id=60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34] [conversation.id=-N9kF0HClC0j7Se-n4Aq] [conversation.participant=user]

Most recipes for pesto sauce call for pine nuts, but you can also use walnuts.

[conversation_id=60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34] [conversation.id=-N9kFRQQHw5DKgalUEE0] [conversation.participant=user]

You should use coarse sea salt, as needed as it acts as an abrasive.

Unless you're reading this from Liguria itself, you probably don't have access to the prized basil of that region. If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that's what it's going to be. Basically, get the best fresh basil you can, and that's all there is to it.

[conversation_id=60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34] [conversation.id=-N9kFq0JmnLsYn-ZpGcZ] [conversation.participant=user]

You should use 3/4 cup (175ml) mildly flavored extra-virgin olive oil

As long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.

[conversation_id=60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34] [conversation.id=-N9kGiKJO8uqKjLt-4bA] [conversation.participant=user]

Exact time is impossible to judge but the best indicator of freshness is the colour of the leaves. Once they turn from green to brown, it is all over for the pesto.

To boost the 'shelf-life' of the pesto in the fridge, make sure that it is completely covered with olive oil before sealing the container.

[conversation_id=60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34] [conversation.id=-N9kH9M6tho8hR2O8wk0] [conversation.participant=user]

Pesto is commonly used on pasta, traditionally with "mandilli de sæa" ("silk handkerchiefs" in the Genoese dialect), trofie or trenette.
