if my eggs are smaller how many will be enough
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKIvoedZ2wXCuCNGxoM] [conversation.participant=user]

I'm sorry, I do not think I have this information. However, as long as you have approximately  3 to 5 eggs, it should be fine for this recipe.

what is a kosher salt
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKIxaDy_ZP6igBtzrfA] [conversation.participant=user]

That is a great question!  Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents.

Feel free to ask any question you might have
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKIzlaYomwJS_iobZeE] [conversation.participant=agent]

should the pot be removed immediately after the herbs have been added ?
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKJ-X2R5KsDMlxlCrr6] [conversation.participant=user]

from the stove
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKJ-_GC_DKgVySgGUPd] [conversation.participant=user]

next step
[conversation_id=pC0jYVl] [conversation.id=-NKJ03LlbWap--2kIF_s] [conversation.participant=user]

You should remove the pot from heat before adding the herbs. After doing so you can proceed by  adding mustard and cheese and beat with wooden spoon until homogenous. You can then  add eggs one at a time, beating vigorously with each addition to prevent eggs from curdling and allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one.  When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine.
