I'm sorry I do not have answer for this question
[conversation_id=LFiNVaQ] [conversation.id=-NGLgeHBxcBnJe1u3wkd] [conversation.participant=agent]

what is the origin of this tart?
[conversation_id=LFiNVaQ] [conversation.id=-NGLglal2oB0RC9JqLuJ] [conversation.participant=user]

New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially "American", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey. "As American as apple pie" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American.

allergy?

Let me see...

If you are allergic to fruits from the  APPLE family (apple, pear), you can still bake an apple pie. These allergic reactions usually occur only when the food is raw. People who are allergic to the raw food can eat it cooked, canned, microwaved, processed or baked. For example, someone allergic to raw apples can eat apple sauce, apple jelly, apple juice, apple pie and dried apples. However, nuts may cause allergic reactions whether raw or cooked. This problem is usually life long.

Let me see...
[conversation_id=LFiNVaQ] [conversation.id=-NGLlBVoLbD6dqCSKOFD] [conversation.participant=agent]

The step says you need to bake until the pie reaches an internal temperature of 195°F (91°C), about 75 minutes.  This is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.

Let me tell you
[conversation_id=LFiNVaQ] [conversation.id=-NGLmGFoqnGHWJExD0pQ] [conversation.participant=agent]

Usually, a commercially prepared apple pie is 52% water, 34% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 11% fat. A 100-gram serving supplies 237 Calories and 13% of the US recommended Daily Value of sodium, with no other micronutrients in significant content.
