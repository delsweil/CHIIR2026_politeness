After about 30 minutes, I realized that to make the dish I wanted to make, the meat would need an hour to marinate after defrosting, so I decided to wait 24 hours to cook the chicken. I then popped the chicken breasts into the fridge. 

My question is: since I started the defrosting process in the bowl of cold water before putting the chicken into the fridge, is the chicken still safe to cook and eat today?
